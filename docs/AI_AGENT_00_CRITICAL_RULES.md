# 00 — Critical Rules: Read This First

> **This document MUST be read before any other document in this repository.**  
> It contains the minimum set of rules that, if violated, will cause data loss, production outages,
> or hours of wasted debugging. Every point here was learned from a past incident.

---

## After Reading This Document

Once you have read all 14 rules below, continue in this order:

```
1. AI_AGENT_01_CONTEXT.md   ← what the project is, live endpoints, tech stack (5 min read)
2. AI_AGENT_01_CONTEXT.md     ← directory tree, where each file lives (5 min read)
3. AI_AGENT_02_ARCHITECTURE.md ← system topology, storage path layout (5 min read)
4. AI_AGENT_06_STATUS.md     ← current health of all 3 cloud environments
5. AI_AGENT_09_TASKS.md      ← prioritised backlog — what to work on next
```

Read these only when the task requires it:

```
AI_AGENT_03_API.md      ← endpoint spec, request/response schema, data model
AI_AGENT_04_INFRA.md    ← Pulumi stacks, resource names, config keys, stack outputs
AI_AGENT_05_CICD.md     ← GitHub Actions workflows, required secrets, trigger conditions
AI_AGENT_07_RUNBOOKS.md ← step-by-step: deploy Lambda, deploy React, GCP Cloud Run, etc.
AI_AGENT_08_SECURITY.md ← auth config per cloud, known security gaps
```

---

## Rule 0 — All Documentation Must Be Written in English

All source code comments, commit messages, pull request descriptions, GitHub Actions workflow
comments, Pulumi stack comments, and documentation files **must be written in English**.

This is a multicloud infrastructure project that may be reviewed by engineers across different
teams. Consistency in English ensures every automated tool (search, grep, AI agents) can
process the content correctly.

---

## Rule 1 — File Operations: Never Create or Edit Many Files in a Single Batch

Creating or editing large numbers of files in a single tool invocation batch can cause network
errors or timeouts. This silently corrupts partial results and is very hard to debug.

**Always work incrementally:**

1. Create or edit **a few files** at a time.
2. Verify each step (compilation check, syntax check, test) before continuing.
3. If a network error occurs mid-way, check what was already written before retrying.

---

## Rule 2 — Dev Container Runs on ARM (aarch64); Production is x86_64

The VS Code dev container is built for `linux/aarch64`. All cloud runtimes (Lambda, Azure
Functions, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions) run on `linux/amd64`. **Native Python packages compiled
on aarch64 are binary-incompatible and will crash at runtime with `.so` import errors.**

**Whenever you install Python packages for deployment, always use Docker with the target
platform explicitly set:**

```bash
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 \
  -v /tmp/deploy:/out python:3.12-slim \
  bash -c "pip install --no-cache-dir --target /out -r requirements.txt -q"
```

This applies to:

- Lambda ZIP packaging (`requirements-aws.txt`, `requirements-layer.txt`)
- GCP Cloud Functions ZIP packaging (`requirements-gcp.txt`)
- Azure Functions deployment (`requirements-azure.txt`)

Do **not** use `pip install` on the host machine (inside the dev container) for generating
deployment artifacts.

---

## Rule 3 — `main` Branch = Immediate Production Deployment

```
develop  →  staging
main     →  production  ← goes live immediately on push
```

Never push directly to `main` unless you intend to deploy to production right away.
Always work on `develop` (or a feature branch), confirm staging is green, then merge to `main`.

---

## Rule 4 — `AUTH_DISABLED` Must Always Be `false` in Staging and Production

The environment variable `AUTH_DISABLED` must be `false` at all times. It was accidentally set
to `true` in a past incident, silently allowing unauthenticated access to all API endpoints.

If you see `AUTH_DISABLED=true` anywhere in CI workflows, Pulumi configs, or `.env` files,
treat it as a critical bug and fix it immediately.

---

## Rule 5 — Lambda / Cloud Run Env Vars Must Come from Pulumi Outputs, Not GitHub Secrets

A past bug caused silently empty `API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT` values because the corresponding
GitHub Secret did not exist in the production environment.

**Pattern to follow** (in `deploy-*.yml`):

```yaml
- name: Get Pulumi outputs
  run: |
    cd infrastructure/pulumi/aws
    echo "API_URL=$(pulumi stack output api_url --stack $STACK)" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

**Never** use `${{ secrets.API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT }}` or similar for values that can be derived
from `pulumi stack output`. If the secret is absent, the variable silently becomes an empty
string, and the Lambda/Function starts up using a hardcoded fallback (often `localhost:8000`).

---

## Rule 6 — AWS Staging Frontend Must Be Built with `VITE_BASE_PATH=/sns/`

The SNS React app is deployed to `s3://bucket/sns/`. Building without `VITE_BASE_PATH=/sns/`
causes all JS/CSS assets to reference `/assets/...`, resulting in 404s. CloudFront then serves
`index.html` with `Content-Type: text/html` for every asset request — breaking the entire app
with a MIME type error.

```bash
cd services/frontend_react
set -a && source .env.aws.staging && set +a
VITE_BASE_PATH=/sns/ npm run build
```

CloudFront custom error pages must also point to `/sns/index.html`, not `/index.html`.

---

## Rule 7 — S3 Images Bucket Is Private: Always Return Presigned GET URLs

`multicloud-auto-deploy-staging-images` has all public access blocked. The backend
must call `_resolve_image_urls()` before returning posts to the frontend. This converts stored
S3 keys (`imageKeys`) to presigned GET URLs with a 1-hour expiry.

Returning raw S3 keys or caching presigned URLs in the database will result in broken image
links after one hour.

---

## Rule 8 — AWS Production CloudFront: Set Pulumi Config Before Any `pulumi up`

Without the following config, `pulumi up --stack production` will revert CloudFront to the
default certificate, causing `NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID` for all HTTPS visitors.

```bash
cd infrastructure/pulumi/aws
pulumi config set customDomain www.aws.ashnova.jp --stack production
pulumi config set acmCertificateArn \
  arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:278280499340:certificate/914b86b1-4c10-4354-91cf-19c4460dcde5 \
  --stack production
```

Always verify these two config values are present before running `pulumi up` on the production
AWS stack.

---

## Rule 9 — Cognito `id_token` Verification: Set `verify_at_hash: False`

When the frontend sends only the `id_token` (without the companion `access_token`), the JWT
library cannot compute or verify `at_hash`. The call to `jwt_verifier.py` must pass
`verify_at_hash=False`. Reverting this setting breaks all authenticated API calls.

See: `services/api/app/jwt_verifier.py`

---

## Rule 10 — GCP: Always Copy `function.py` as `main.py` in the Deployment ZIP

Cloud Build fails with `missing main.py` even when `--entry-point` names a different function.
The fix is to include `main.py` in the deployment source:

```bash
cp services/api/function.py /tmp/deploy_gcp/.deployment/main.py
```

Always include both `function.py` and `main.py` in the ZIP. Failing to do so causes Cloud
Build to reject the source and the function will not be updated.

---

## Rule 11 — GCP: `generate_signed_url()` Requires `service_account_email` + `access_token`

Cloud Run and Cloud Functions use Compute Engine credentials (access token only — no private
key). Calling `blob.generate_signed_url()` without the extra arguments raises:

```
AttributeError: you need a private key to sign credentials
```

The correct call:

```python
blob.generate_signed_url(
    expiration=3600,
    method="GET",
    service_account_email=settings.gcp_service_account,
    access_token=credentials.token,
)
```

The service account email is provided via env var `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` on the Cloud Run
service. The SA must also have `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`.

---

## Rule 12 — GCP: Firebase Authorized Domains Must Be Registered via Identity Toolkit API

When a new Cloud Run URL or custom domain is added, it must be explicitly registered in
Firebase Auth. Use the Identity Toolkit Admin v2 `PATCH` endpoint with the header
`x-goog-user-project: PROJECT_ID` — omitting this header returns `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`
even with a valid admin token.

This step is automated in `deploy-gcp.yml` (`Update Firebase Authorized Domains`).
Do not remove or skip it.

---

## Rule 13 — GCP: CDN Must Send `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups`

Without this response header, Firebase `signInWithPopup` cannot check `popup.closed`, causing
repeated COOP warnings and potentially breaking the login flow in strict browser environments.

Set this as a CDN backend bucket custom response header (in Pulumi and/or via `gcloud`).
After any change, invalidate the CDN cache:

```bash
gcloud compute url-maps invalidate-cdn-cache <URL_MAP_NAME> \
  --path "/*" --project ashnova
```

---

## Rule 14 — Azure Functions: CORS Must Be Configured at the Platform Level, Not in Python Code

Azure Functions (Flex Consumption) runs **Kestrel (.NET HTTP server) in front of the Python
runtime**. Kestrel intercepts all `OPTIONS` preflight requests before they reach the Python
code. Setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in FastAPI CORS middleware has **no effect** —
Kestrel returns the response before the middleware is reached.

**Always configure CORS via Azure CLI or Portal:**

```bash
# Function App CORS (controls API calls from browsers)
az functionapp cors add \
  --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --name "$FUNCTION_APP_NAME" \
  --allowed-origins "https://your.domain.com"

# Remove wildcard first if present (wildcards suppress individual origins)
az functionapp cors remove \
  --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --name "$FUNCTION_APP_NAME" \
  --allowed-origins '*'
```

**Azure Blob Storage CORS is completely independent** from Function App CORS.
Image uploads go directly to Blob Storage via SAS URL (bypassing Function App).
Blob Storage CORS must be set separately:

```bash
az storage cors add \
  --account-name "$STORAGE_ACCOUNT" \
  --services b \
  --methods GET POST PUT DELETE OPTIONS \
  --origins "https://your.domain.com" \
  --allowed-headers "*" \
  --exposed-headers "*" \
  --max-age 3600
```

Also: `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT` is **not supported** on Flex Consumption — it triggers
`InvalidAppSettingsException`. Always build packages locally with Docker before deploying.

---

## Rule 15 — Azure Functions: `host.json` Must Set `routePrefix: ""`

Azure Functions defaults to `routePrefix: "api"`, which prefixes all HTTP triggers with
`/api/`. The frontend calls paths like `/posts`, `/health` without the `/api/` prefix.
Without this fix, every API endpoint returns 404.

**Required `host.json` content:**

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "extensions": {
    "http": {
      "routePrefix": ""
    }
  },
  "extensionBundle": {
    "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle",
    "version": "[4.*, 5.0.0)"
  }
}
```

Also: Azure AD `post_logout_redirect_uri` must be explicitly registered in the app's
`redirect_uris`. Only registering the `/sns/auth/callback` callback URL is insufficient —
the logout return URL (e.g. `/sns/`) must also be added:

```bash
az ad app update \
  --id "$AD_APP_ID" \
  --web-redirect-uris \
    "https://your.domain.com/sns/auth/callback" \
    "https://your.domain.com/sns/"
```

## Rule 16 — Actively Use GitHub Features

This project is designed to maximize the use of GitHub's built-in features. Leverage them actively
when executing tasks:

### GitHub Issues

- When you find a new task, bug, or improvement, **always create a GitHub Issue** using
  `gh issue create`
- Update progress via `gh issue comment` to keep context in the Issue
- Assign labels (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `security`, etc.) to categorize work

```bash
# Create an issue
gh issue create --title "Title" --body "Description" --label bug,high-priority

# Comment on an issue with progress update
gh issue comment <ISSUE_NUMBER> --body "Progress: ..."

# Add labels to an issue
gh issue edit <ISSUE_NUMBER> --add-label enhancement
```

### Pull Requests

- **Always use Pull Requests for code changes** (direct push to `main` is forbidden — see Rule 3)
- Include in every PR:
  - Clear title using Conventional Commits (`feat(api): ...`, `fix(ui): ...`, etc.)
  - Description of changes
  - Related Issue number (`Closes #123`)
  - Required reviewers (`@PLAYER1-r7`, etc.)

```bash
# Create feature branch and open PR
git checkout -b feature/new-endpoint develop
git push origin feature/new-endpoint
gh pr create --base develop --title "feat(api): add /posts endpoint" \
  --body "Closes #25"
```

### GitHub Releases and CHANGELOG

- Tag versions with `v1.2.3` format
- Release creation is automated via `.github/workflows/release.yml` — just push the tag
- Release Notes and CHANGELOG.md are generated automatically

```bash
# Tag a version (Release auto-generation is triggered)
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

### Branch Protection Rules

- `main` branch is protected with strict rules (PR required, approval required, Code Owner review required)
- `develop` branch requires PR while balancing development velocity and security
- See [docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md](./BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md) for details

### GitHub Discussions

- Use GitHub Discussions for questions, suggestions, and knowledge sharing
- Categories: 📢 Announcements, 💡 Ideas & Feedback, 🤝 General Discussion, ❓ Q&A, 🔧 Technical Help

```bash
# Access Discussions at Web UI: https://github.com/PLAYER1-r7/multicloud-auto-deploy/discussions
```

**Benefits of using GitHub Features:**
- 🔄 Automatic project progress visibility
- 📊 Unified task management and GitHub Issues
- 🚀 Automated releases + CHANGELOG generation
- 🛡️ Enforced PR-based code review workflow
- 📚 Auto-published documentation via GitHub Pages

## Rule 17 — You May Install Required Applications

In the Dev Container environment, you are free to install any application needed to complete tasks
(tools, libraries, CLIs, etc.).

### Approved Installation Methods

**Always OK to install:**

- Python packages (`pip install`)
- Node.js packages (`npm install`)
- Docker images (`docker pull`)
- Development tools (`git`, `curl`, `jq`, `terraform`, `pulumi`, `aws`, `az`, `gcloud`, etc.)
- System packages (`apt install` as needed)

**Guidelines:**

1. Use standard package managers (`apt`, `pip`, `npm`) and document installations
2. Verify functionality after installation (e.g., `--version`)
3. For important tools (new language runtimes, etc.), update CONTRIBUTING.md

```bash
# Install Python packages (recommended)
pip install --upgrade pandas requests

# Upgrade AWS CLI
aws --version && pip install --upgrade awscli

# Install system packages (if needed)
apt-get update && apt-get install -y jq curl

# Verify installation
python3 --version
terraform -version
```

### Dependency Updates

Dependabot automatically checks dependencies weekly and proposes security updates as PRs
(see [docs/GITHUB_FEATURES_GUIDE.md](./GITHUB_FEATURES_GUIDE.md)).
