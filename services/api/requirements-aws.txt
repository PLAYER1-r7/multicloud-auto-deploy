# AWS Lambda Application Code Requirements
# Dependencies in this file are deployed with the Lambda function code
# Most dependencies are in the Lambda Layer (requirements-layer.txt)
# 
# This file should remain minimal to keep Lambda package size under 50MB
# for direct ZIP upload (no S3 required)

# Note: All main dependencies (FastAPI, Pydantic, Mangum, etc.) are in Lambda Layer
# Note: boto3 is pre-installed in Lambda runtime, no need to include

# Currently, all dependencies are in Lambda Layer
# If you need additional dependencies for your function code only, add them here
